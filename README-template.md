## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow




### What I learned

I learnt how to usehtml sematic though if you check closely it was applied towards the end of the work.
I needed to include it to make it acessible for all users.




### Continued development

proper use of flex box, percentage and alignment + including all html5 sematics

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)- This helped me for html5 sematics. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
